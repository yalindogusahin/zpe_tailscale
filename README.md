After running tailscale service you need visit the URL that tailscaled service created.

To authenticate yourself by 3 options. (Microsoft, Google, Github)

If you want to run tailscale service when the device boots up.

Place this script to the directory as /home/root/tailscale.sh

    #!/bin/bash
    #start tailscale
    /home/root/tailscale_1.32.2_386/tailscaled &

Also we need to place init.d script to /etc/init.d as blah

    #! /bin/sh
    # /etc/init.d/blah
    #

    # Some things that run always
    touch /var/lock/blah

    # Carry out specific functions when asked to by the system
    case "$1" in
      start)
        echo "Starting script blah "
        echo "Could do more here"
        /home/root/tailscale_1.32.2_386/tailscaled &
        ;;
      stop)
        echo "Stopping script blah"
        echo "Could do more here"
        ;;
      *)
        echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/blah {start|stop}"
        exit 1
        ;;
    esac

    exit 0

Once you've saved your file into the correct location make sure that it's executable by running

    chmod 755 /etc/init.d/blah

Then you need to add the appropriate symbolic links to cause the script to be executed when the system goes down, or comes up.

The simplest way of doing this is to use the Debian-specific command update-rc.d
    
    update-rc.d blah defaults
